# Baan Sub Takhian Royal Development Project website
Welcome to the Baan Sub Takhian Royal Development Project, a local government organization in Thailand operating under the Department of National Parks, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation. A primary mission of an organisation is to conserve and restore forest resources and wildlife within the Taboâ€“Huai Yai Wildlife Sanctuary.
## Website objectives
  As a subdivision of the Protected Area Regional Office 11, Baan Sub Takhian lacked a dedicated communication channel. By establishing this website, I aimed to bridge the communication gap that existed between an organization and the local community. The website is designed to be an educational hub by providing valuable insights into the ongoing development of this state agency. Visitors can learn about its conservation efforts, environmental initiatives, and wildlife protection programs.  Through this online platform, an organisation can also share relevant news and upcoming events with the nearby villagers.
